I would have liked to spend more time on the JavaScript side but ran out of time. I did have the notices/JS working at one point, but I forgot that I was manually compiling the styles and JS at the time. I made some changes along the way and realized it was broken when I set up the app from scratch again. It's probably something simple, but I wanted to honor the time constraint. I also noticed a few quirks along the way since I was moving quickly to focus on the frontend.

Also would have made smaller commits but did larger bulk commits given the time.
